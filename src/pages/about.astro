        <h1>Hello, my name is AurÃ©lien Audelin ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">If you're not french chances are you won't pronounce it well. But that's ok, I'm not
            even mad...</p>
        <p>Thanks for landing on my website (I should have done it years ago, but who even cares)</p>
        <p>Well, you probably already figured that out but I'm French, what you may not know is that I am also a fullstack CTO.</p>
        <p>Tech is the kind of art I'm most found of, designing and coding amazing SaaS applications, scaling wonderful teams
            and eventually experiencing user feedbacks.</p>
        <p>I value true relationships, communities, transparency, leadership and freedom.</p>
